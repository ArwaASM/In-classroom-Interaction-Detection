# How to Train YOLOv8, Faster-RCNN, and RetinaNet Object Detection Models on our Custom Dataset to Detect In-classroom Interactions

## Introduction
This project uses three object detection algorithms: YOLOv8, Faster-RCNN, and RetinaNet to detect four main in-classroom interactions in video frames. This includes utilizing seven models: two versions of YOLOv8, three Faster-RCNN, and Two Retinanet. The code provides three main components: handling the dataset prepared by Roboflow, training the seven models, and evaluating them. A comparison of these models will ultimately be conducted to determine the most robust model.
