# How to Train YOLOv8, Faster-RCNN, and RetinaNet Object Detection Models on our Custom Dataset to Detect In-classroom Interactions

## Introduction
This project uses three object detection algorithms: YOLOv8, Faster-RCNN, and RetinaNet to detect four main in-classroom interactions in video frames. This includes utilizing seven models: two versions of YOLOv8, three Faster-RCNN, and Two Retinanet. The code provides three main components: handling the dataset prepared by Roboflow, training the seven models, and evaluating them. A comparison of these models will ultimately be conducted to determine the most robust model.  
## Features
- Imported two versions (YOLOv8 and COCO formats) of our custom In-classroom Interactions dataset prepared using Roboflow that contains 7271 images.

- Trained YOLOv8  (YOLOv8l, YOLOv8x) on the dataset with YOLOv8 format, Faster R-CNN (R_50, R_101, and RX_101), and RetinaNet (R_50, R_101) models on the dataset with COCO format.

- Evaluated the classroom video recordings using the trained models to detect: 
1. Using Textbook: Opened Book, Closed Book, Electronic Book, No Book, and Worksheet.
2. Participation: Raising Hands and Answering.
3. Teacher Activities: Teacher Follows up Students and Teacher Explains.
4. Student Activities: Student Reads and Student Writes.

- Saved the testing dataset with bounding boxes and confidence scores.

- Compared the models' accuracy, and selected the most accurate one, to be optimized later.

## Dataset Preparation
Our dataset was created and prepared using the Roboflow tool, where the real classroom video recordings were segmented into frames, where the frame rate was one frame every three seconds. Roboflow is also utilized to assign multiple labels for each image during the image annotation process to feed the object detection models effectively. After cleaning and annotating, the dataset size was reduced to 3,025 images, automatically oriented, and resized to 224 × 224 pixels. 

The next step was to apply an image augmentation process to improve our models' performance and generalization ability, thus increasing their capacity to perform effectively on unseen images. To this end, we applied three types of augmentation resulting in 7,259 images: 
1. Rotation: 15-degree rotation
2. Saturation: 25% increase in saturation
3. Noise: 1.02% added noise.

The dataset was split into 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing. There are 6369 training set images, 452 validating, and 450 tests, totaling 7271 images. Moreover, our dataset includes 31265 labels.
